# RATATOSKR — DOCUMENTATION INDEX

This directory defines the **execution contract** of RATATOSKR.

These documents are normative.

---

## Documents

- **PROVENANCE.md**  
  Defines what RATATOSKR guarantees and what it explicitly refuses to do.

- **TRACE.md**  
  Defines the immutable execution record and its required structure.

- **TASK.md**  
  Defines the only legal interface for execution.

---

## Reading Order

1. PROVENANCE.md — why the system exists
2. TRACE.md — how execution is made durable
3. TASK.md — how execution is initiated

---

## Contract Status

These documents define the minimum guarantees required for RATATOSKR v1.0.

Any change that weakens these guarantees requires a scope change.

If behavior and documentation disagree, the documentation wins.
